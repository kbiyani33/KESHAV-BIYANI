Working on Digital Circuit Design for FPGA Designing.
This repository is divided into two subsections. One for Combinational Logic Design and Sequential Logic Design same as Digital Circuits. 
The codes have been written in Verilog. The software used for running the codes is ModelSim 10.4 which has an inbuilt wave display. 

Of course there are several other softwares available. Some of which include Icarus Verilog. However there's no wave viewing inbuit and gtk wave has to be downloaded separately. However I  have always preferred ModelSim. 

Student Version of Modelsim can be downloaded from the link: https://www.mentor.com/company/higher_ed/modelsim-student-edition.
